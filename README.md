Fruit Detection – Identifies different fruits from photos in real time.

Nutritional Insights – Provides nutrition facts for each detected fruit.

Allergy Awareness – Highlights fruits the user is allergic to, helping avoid risks.

User-Friendly Interface – Clean, simple design for ease of use.

This project combines computer vision with user-centric functionality, making healthy eating and allergy management more accessible.
